Problem 2

This is a render of a realistic simulation of a frictionless pendulum wave/pendulum snake.

This render is implemented with my original physics to make it behave very realistically. A light model was also implemented to make it seem more realistic.
To create the physics, I studied extensively on the pendulum and made adaptations and decisions to see which physical aspects were necessary for this simulation. 

You can't really interact with the program except for just enjoying the satisfying smooth yet realistic motions of the pendulums.

Everything is implemented by me.

However, to prevent doing the same things twice, I had referenced my code for lighting models and normal calculations from my previous Standford bunny render and implemented it into my pendulum code, therefore, the parts where I had studied off the internet for the bunny is applied in this render as well. 

I had studied these four links for formulas and calculations for the pendulum:

I had studied the pendulum and pendulum wave and had implemented the provided lengths of the strings/cables from the real-life model example to ensure that my pendulums do indeed make a pendulum wave. 

For the pendulum wave, as long as you're patient enough, it does eventually all sync up again.

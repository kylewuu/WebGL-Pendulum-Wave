This is a render of a pendulum wave or pendulum snake.

Everything is implemented by me.

However, to prevent doing the same things twice, I had referenced my code for lighting models and normal calculations from my previous standford bunny render and implemented it into my pendulum code.

I had studied these four links:

I had studied the pendulum and pendulum wave, and had implemented the length of the strings/cables from his real life model to ensure that my pendulums was indeed a pendulum wave. 

All implementations was done by completely by me.

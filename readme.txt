Everything in the code is written by me. However, there are some parts where I had discussed with a friend, or had studied from the WWW.

The things that my friend/classmate Julian and I had discussed are:
	How to calculate the normal vector and matrix.

The things that I had studied online are:
	How to set up the few lines in the fragment and vertext shader for Phong Shading. This was partly studied from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/phong-demo/ and discussed with my friend and classmate Julian. However, I still did my own work.
Other than this one thing, everything is done by me and learned from the lectures and lecture slides
	
The things that are complete are the following:
	a) Drawing the bunny using persepctive projection
	b) Interactively translating the bunny
	c) Interactively rotating the bunny
	d) The auto rotating point light as a cube and rotates properly
	e) The wireframe cone is drawn and pans, however there is no spotlight coming from it.
	f) Phong reflection and shading are finished, and is affected by the bunny's position and orientations
	g) The screenshot is included

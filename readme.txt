This is a render of a realistic simlulation of a frictionless pendulum wave/pendulum snake.

This render is implemented with my original physics to make it behave very realistically.

Everything is implemented by me.

However, to prevent doing the same things twice, I had referenced my code for lighting models and normal calculations from my previous standford bunny render and implemented it into my pendulum code.

I had studied these four links for formulas and calculations for the pendulum:

I had studied the pendulum and pendulum wave, and had implemented the provided lengths of the strings/cables from his real life model to ensure that my pendulums was indeed a pendulum wave. 

All implementations was done by completely by me.

For the pendulum wave, as long as you wait long enough, it does all sync up again.
